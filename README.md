## üëã Hello!
I'm a QA and Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience.  Worked on large enterprise products, startup ventures, and an award-winning publication.  Familiar with both remote, and in-office roles.  Always seeking to take ownership of the project and exceed expectations.

Test automation with Playwright, an end-to-end testing framework. Initial impressions are... I like the ability to "auto" wait for actionable elements, and how it handles execution tracing and error logging. So far so good. :+1:
